# Brews and Beans

A simple application I followed along with a tutorial. Runs off Flutter framework. It has user login/registration and allows you to customize preference in settings to set certain coffee strength, your name and how many sugars you want. Uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for backend.

### Concepts I learned:
- Learned about nesting widgets inside widgets and how Flutter LOVE's to just nest anything and everything.
- Learned the key differences between stateful and stateless widgets
- How to retrieve data snapshots from Firebase and map it to update user data
- How stream builders work for listening to changes in user defined objects to rebuild the widget with the most recent data event
- Building data models to organize our data and pass it to and from classes
- Utilizing Firebase to authenticate users
- Creating form validation for security and data integrity


### Summary
I learned that Flutter can at first be overwhelming with the amount of widgets they offer, especially with all the nesting. Once I overcame that, you really get a true understanding of how powerful the framework can be at providing state management, the ease of installing packages and how easy it is to quickly setup a working application with minimum code (and even a deep understanding of Flutter's API for that matter).
